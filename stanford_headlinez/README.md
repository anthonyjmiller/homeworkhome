## Background

Info being ported over from compciv class site: 
http://2018.compciv.org/assignments/week-03/stanford_headlinez.html

### Answers

- [scraper.py](scraper.py)



### Test suite

The test suite for this assignment can be found in the file:

[test_scraper.py](test_scraper.py)

You can read the assertions and get an idea of what's expected from each function.

If you want to run it yourself locally, copy the contents of the file and save it as `test_scraper.py`, in the same working directory as your `scraper.py` file.

To run the test suite, simply type the following command at your system shell:

```sh
$  pytest
```
