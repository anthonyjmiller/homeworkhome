# stanford_headlinez_souped: Scraping web news with Beautiful Soup

If you attempted the [stanford_headlinez](stanford_headlinez) assignment and found its notion of "web scraping" to be asinine and mentally devastating, then congrats, that's a good sign of rationality.

This assignment covers the same target -- extracting headlines from the Stanford news page. However, instead of using string `split()` methods to extract the headline text, it uses the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library.


## Technical requirements

Your program should consist of a single file named `bscraper.py`. 

You can download a skeleton/draft of that file, with the function names/documentation filled out, here:
